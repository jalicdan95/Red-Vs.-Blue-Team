# Red-Vs.-Blue-Team
This project documents each step taken as both teams, whereas Red Team I attacked a vulnerable VM, ultimately gaining root access. As Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs to extract hard data and visualizations, ultimately interpreting log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit successfully performed.
